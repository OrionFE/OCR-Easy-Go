        <p>You want to experience skydiving for the first time ?<br><br> provides a unique combination of adrenalin-fuelled exhilaration and perfectly calm tranquillity. While in freefall it's all about the rush -- but once the parachute opens and your heart rate steadies, you'll take a moment to gaze around you and see the whole world in a new light. It's beautiful up there, and the experience is about as close to flying as humans can actually get.</p>
